         <h1> The Japanese Page </h1>

         <p>
         This is a collection of commonly recommended resources for learning
         the Japanese language, annotated with notes about the best way to
         use them. This page aims to solve questions like 'What is the best way to learn
         the language?', 'How do I get the most out of X?' and so on.
         </p>

         <h2> How hard is it to learn Japanese? </h2>

         <p>
         The Foreign Service Institute classifies Japanese as a "Category V"
         Language, deemed "exceptionally difficult for native English speakers".
         </p>

         <p>
         It's important to know that this only means it will take more <i>time</i>
         to learn. Everybody can learn Japanese, but it will take you on order
         of 2000 hours of continuous study to become proficient.
         </p>

         <p>
         Japanese is a popular language to learn especially among young people,
         so you will find many online resorces, apps, communities etc to help you.
         </p>

         <h2> Surveying the Language </h2>

         Here are some brief language overviews to give you an idea of what
         learning the Japanese language will entail, and give you some historical
         perspective:

         <ul><li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9-e_3GHrzw">langfocus - The Japanese Language</a> </li></ul>

         <h2> What to learn </h2>

         You will want to start by learning the <strong>Kana</strong>. After this
         you can begin learning <strong>Grammar</strong>, <strong>Vocabulary</strong>
         and <strong>Kanji</strong> concurrently until you are a confident
         enough in your ability to start reading and listening to simple material.

         <h2> Learning Strategies </h2>

         <p>
         There are many schools of thought when it comes to the 'best' way to learn
         Japanese. Some of the more popular ideas are:
         </p>

         <p>
         <strong> The textbook jockey </strong> relies on textbooks to give learners a
         straight and clear path through the language. You read textbooks to exhaustion,
         do all the exercises, and then pick a new textbook afterwards.
         </p>

         <p>
         <strong> The sentence miner </strong> eschews exhaustively focusing on textbook
         exercises and instead recommends building up Anki decks of hundreds or thousands
         of example sentences. Whenever you come across an interesting sentence, or one
         that has something you want to learn, you add it to Anki.
         </p>

         <p>
         <strong> Full Immersion </strong> fully immerses you in Japanese, listening to
         Japanese content all the hours of the day, and replaces all english language media
         (tv shows, movies, music, etc) with Japanese equivalents. They don't use textbooks
         very much, and they focus on accumilating thousands of sentences in Anki.
         </p>

         <p>
         <strong> Anki Droning </strong> downloads pre-made Anki decks such as the
         Core 6k deck and spends their time reviewing their Anki cards. After they've
         exhausted those, they will begin reading native content, adding anything new
         they find to their Anki decks.
         </p>

         <h2> Setting up Anki </h2>

         <p>
         Anki is a flashcard app that lets you create flashcards about anything
         you want to remember. Anki will then ask you to review them at the most
         optimal time. It is a brilliant way make sure that you don't forget anything
         that you learn; it's the cork that plugs up the leaky bucket that is your
         brain.
         </p>

         Here are some guides on the best ways to use Anki:

         </ul>

         <h2> Learning the Kana </h2>

         Japanese uses two different Kana syllabaries in the written language:
         <strong>Hiragana</strong> and <strong>Katakana</strong>. These are simple
         sets of ~40 characters that stand in for sounds, like our english alphabet.
         Learning them should take you a few hours to a few days.

         </ul>

         <h2> Learning Grammar with Textbooks </h2>

         <p>
         A good textbook can be a great resource as long as you make sure
         not to rely on it too much. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5IPArDxO40">
         There is a great lingosteve video on this subject here.</a>
         </p>

         <p>
         These are the most commonly recommended textbooks for each level of study:
         </p>

         Elementary level

         <ul><li> Genki I & II </li></ul>

         Intermediate level

         <ul>
             <li> Tobira intermediate Japanese </li>
             <li> Integrated Approach To Intermediate Japanese </li>
         </ul>

         Advanced level

         <ul>
             <li> Authentic Japanese </li>
             <li> Kanzen Master Series </li>
         </ul>

         <h2> Learning Grammar with Online Resources </h2>

         If you don't want to buy a TextBook, or want to supplement your grammar
         learning, there are several great online resources that teach Grammar:

         <ul>
           <li><a href="http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar">Tae Kim Guide</a></li>
           <li><a href="https://www.wasabi-jpn.com/japanese-grammar/wasabis-online-japanese-grammar-reference/">Wasabi Grammar Reference</a></li>
           <li><a href="https://sakubi.neocities.org">Sakubi Grammar Guide</a></li>
           <li><a href="https://www2.gwu.edu/~eall/vjgnew/vjghomepage/vjghome.htm">Visualising Japanese Grammar</a></li>
           <li><a href="http://www.japaneseverbconjugator.com/">Verb Conjugator App</a></li>
         </ul>

         <h2> How to use a grammar Textbook </h2>

         You can use the following approach to get the most out of any Textbook:

         <ol>
             <li>Skim read the content once to get an idea of what you'll be learning</li>
             <li>Read the content a second time, more deeply. Aim to read a few pages a day</li>
             <li>(Optional) Do any exercises in the book</li>
             <li>For everything you learn, find an example sentence and bring it into Anki</li>
             <li>After you finish the book, keep reviewing your Anki cards so you don't forget anything</li>
         </ol>

         <p>
         It is up to you whether you want to memorise the vocabulary and kanji content
         in addition to grammar rules.
         </p>

         <p>
         If you are learning vocabulary/Kanji through the Anki Core decks or WaniKani,
         then I would ignore the particular vocabulary the book is using. If an example
         sentence you want to bring into Anki contains vocabulary you don't know, you can
         swap the words for ones that you <i>do</i> know, if you are confident that your
         change is correct.
         </p>

         <p>If on the other hand, you are not learning Kanji and Vocabulary by other means,
         then you can attempt to learn the vocabulary and kanji in the textbook</p>

         <h2> Kanji Resources </h2>

         The third component of the Japanese written language is Kanji. You
         need to learn around 2000 Kanji characters to be considered literate.
         Since learning the Kanji may take you a year or more, you should learn
         Kanji alongside all of your other studies.

         <h2> Conversation & Ouput Practice </h2>

         <p>
         There are conflicting ideas on when is the best time to start outputting
         (writing and conversing in Japanese). Some argue that output should be
         delayed until you have a significant amount of study already accomplished
         (around a year) so that you don't accidentally reinforce any bad habits.
         </p>

         <p>
         Whether you choose to start outputting immediately, or later on, there
         are many resources that will let you talk to native Japanese people to
         practice your conversation skills.
